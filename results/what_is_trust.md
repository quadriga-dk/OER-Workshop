1. The data on trust was collected in the context of a survey conducted by the [World Values Survey (WVS)](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSEVStrend.jsp) and the [European Values Study (EVS)](https://europeanvaluesstudy.eu/).

2. Participants were asked about their trust in other people, specifically whether they believe that most people can be trusted or if one needs to be careful in dealing with others.

    One of the questions asked was: "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?"

3. Some of the variables are:
    - Share of people agreeing with the statement "most people can be trusted"

:class: exercise

Compare the results for the following countries:
- China
- Finland

Note down the differences and rank the countries by the measurement difference.

```{admonition} Solution
:class: solution, dropdown
The differences in trust measurement for the selected countries are as follows:
- China: NA
- Finland: 11 percentage points
- France: 6.2 percentage points
- Germany: 6.5 percentage points
- United States: NA
- Zimbabwe: 0.6 percentage points

The ranking of the countries by measurement difference is therefore:
1. Finland (11 percentage points)
2. Germany (6.5 percentage points)
3. France (6.2 percentage points)
4. Zimbabwe (0.6 percentage points)
5. China (NA)
6. United States (NA)
