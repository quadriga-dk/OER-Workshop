# Timetable

We have 90 minutes for the workshop. The goal is to give You a first experience with our template and the way QUADRIGA uses the technologies. We expect people with different skill levels to participate – some of you will have much experience with Python, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, or Markdown, while others will have little to no experience.

The following timetable is our proposal for the workshop. Every participant should follow their own pace and can either take their time to work through sections or use the bonus chapter for more advanced topics. You should be able to complete the main sections in self-study if You can't finish them during the workshop. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out during the workshop or afterwards.
