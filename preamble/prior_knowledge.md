# Prior Knowledge

You don't need to bring any specific prior knowledge. We offer three different access methods:

**📘 Book-Only Mode:** Read our interactive textbook in the browser with limited interaction capabilities. Requires no programming knowledge or experience with Jupyter Notebooks.

**🌨️ Cloud Mode:** Execute and customize the included Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab or Binder. Chapters with executable notebooks are marked with a _rocket symbol_ (🚀) - click on it to open the notebook in one of these Notebook hosts.

**💻 Local Mode:** Download the Jupyter Notebooks to your computer for local execution (e.g., in Anaconda Navigator). Enables the use of local data and comprehensive customizations.

Choose the approach that best fits your requirements. You can switch between methods at any time.
