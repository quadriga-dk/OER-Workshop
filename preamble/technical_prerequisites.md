# (Technical) Prerequisites

This template is designed for use within the workshop and with <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" class="external-link">GitHub</a>. You need a GitHub account, which can also be created just for the workshop.

To use the GitHub Pages functionality, your practice OER must be publicly available.

Editing files works best either in a local editor or directly in GitHub. You can also use JupyterHub to edit Jupyter Notebooks, for example â€“ files created this way must be downloaded and then uploaded to GitHub.

QUADRIGA uses <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">Jupyter Book</a> {cite}`executable_books_community_2021` as its underlying technology.
