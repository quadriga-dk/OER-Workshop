This chapter gives you an overview of creating content in Jupyter Book. It covers [setup and configuration files](setup.md), [basic markup in Markdown](markdown.md), and the use of [Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter_notebooks.ipynb) in Jupyter Book.

Your result will be a configured Jupyter Book with initial content created by you, providing a good foundation for creating your OER.
