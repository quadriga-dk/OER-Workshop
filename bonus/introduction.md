```

The bonus chapter provides you with material to continue working â€“ whether during the workshop because you already know certain aspects, or after the workshop. As a transition to using other QUADRIGA resources or the Jupyter Book documentation itself, you will find guidance in this chapter on how to [use the advanced markup features of MyST-Markdown](typography.md), how to [make MyST-Markdown files executable](executable_markdown.md), how simple [assessment with Jupyter Quiz](jupyterquiz.ipynb) is implemented, and how to [publish your OER with the Zenodo plugin](zenodo.md).

You can work through all content in sequence or just work on what currently interests you.
