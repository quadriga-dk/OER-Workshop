# GitHub

GitHub serves multiple purposes relevant for this workshop:
- It hosts the Git repository you will work in. While Git is a distributed version control system and thus users can have a full copy on their local machine, GitHub provides a central place to share and collaborate on a repository.
- It provides a web interface to view and edit files.
- It allows you to publish your Jupyter Book as a website for free. This is done by using a GitHub Action to build the book and then deploy it to the web server GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Account
To participate in this workshop, you need a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, please create one at https://github.com/signup.

## GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions are a way to automate tasks in your GitHub repository. Actions are run based on a trigger event, such as a push to the repository or a pull request. The Action itself spawns a virtual machine that runs the specified commands.

## GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a service that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Depending on the definition of the GitHub Action used, the website can be automatically updated whenever you push changes to the repository.
